# Fighting Fire with Data

The Texas Department of Outdoor and Nature Things has recently received an additional $10 million in state funding for wildfire prevention. The department has hired our firm to help make an informed decision about where to best invest their funds. 

## Considerations
- Education and Marketing: Which audience is best suited to receive wildfire prevention education?
- Law Enforcement: Would an increase in penalties create positive change?
- Area/Regions of Concern: Which locations would benefit the most from the deployment of preventative measures?
- Prediction: Are there significant changes in the intensity, speed, or size of wildfires?
