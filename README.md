The Texas Department of Outdoor and Nature Things has recently received an additional $10 million in state funding for wildfire prevention. The department has hired our firm to help make an informed decision about where to best invest their funds.

### Considerations
- Education and Marketing: Which audience is best suited to receive wildfire prevention education?
- Law Enforcement: Would an increase in penalties create positive change?
- Area/Regions of Concern: Which locations would benefit the most from the deployment of preventative measures?
- Prediction: Are there significant changes in the intensity, speed, or size of wildfires?

### Proposal

### Project
The goal of the project is to provide a consistent, comparable set of scientific results to be used as a foundation for wildfire mitigation and prevention planning across Texas. Results of the assessment can be used to help prioritize areas in the state where tactical analyses, community interaction and education, or mitigation treatments might be necessary to reduce risk from wildfires. -tamu

### ETL

### Visualizations
Through the use of data visualizations, large volumes of data can be readily transformed into comprehensible information to assess high risk areas and help prioritize preventive action.
